<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Okay let me introduce myself, my name is Muhammad Rafihan and usually called Rafi or just pihan. And when i write this commit, I was 16 years old
and sit on Senior Highschool in my city. And now I have a very big dream which is being a senior programmer or software engineer that can 
work remotely around the world</p>

<p>And now here I am, still learning how to write a code properly with Dr. Angela Yu course, And someday I just want to be sit on my chair
or maybe still outside that still can do my job which is remote job. Seems fun, all i need just a laptop and perseverance. And maybe that's
all from me, hope for all of you guys being always good. See you on later repo </p>
